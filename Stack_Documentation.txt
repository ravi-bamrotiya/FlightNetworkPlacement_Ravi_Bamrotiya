Stack Validate:
Here input is string like 4321098765.
after input the string converting that string into a int array.
after that calling a isValid() function.
Here I am actually push and pop the value in stack.
np(next position) is set to zero.
first I am pushing the value 0 to first value of string(d[index]) after that 
chacking with top of stack and current value from input string if it 
match then pop the elemnt till it match and if not match then it means number is 
greater then top of stack den pushing value again and then pop again if there is no pop or push 
it means invalid sequence and set achieve=flase.
